# Homography-and-Image-Stitching-From-Scratch

Implementation of image stitching using homography to create panoramic images. 

No extra method was used for point selection, it can be either done by selecting points by hand or giving the coordinates.
Homography and Stitching functions were created from scratch, therefore, results can be improved by adding blending and normalization options.

Created for an assignment of Computer Vision course of Boğaziçi University. Example results can be found in Paris images.
